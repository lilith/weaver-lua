        Inside the foyer, dust is 
        strewn about everywhere in the poorly-lit lobby. A rusty 10-candle chandelier 
        hangs swaying, secured to the ancient ceiling by only a frayed strand of old 
        rope. Cobwebs and their artisans--black spiders with hairy, orange legs--
        litters the nooks and crannies. Several doors extend from this room, each leading 
        into a maze of rooms and studies. One door in particular catches your eye. 
        This door, nestled awkwardly into a corner is barred tightly from the outside. 
        It is easy enough to unlatch, but it was likely barricaded this way for a reason. 
        Finally, a set of staircases lies across from you, ascending into a fog of 
        blackness.
