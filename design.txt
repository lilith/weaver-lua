Git repository for source code.

Some data is stored in the same repository, such as translations, world data, etc. 


Specially named files across the world are loaded for every request. .always.lua, for example. 

Files should be memcached by hash. 




'p' function should provide output capabilities. Out-of-stream things like menu commands should be adjusted through an object.

TODO: String interpolation (makes translation easier)
