# Weaver on Lua

A prototype implementation of the Weaver engine on Lua, using Pluto for persistence. 


Check out kernel/kernel.lua to understand how coroutines are used to make asynchronous waits synchronous.


## Library reference

Game scripting is pretty straightforward. Each area has its own .lua file. Each file can have multiple places in it.

* town.lua
* home.lua
* forest.lua
