# Weaver on Lua

A prototype implementation of the Weaver engine on Lua, using Pluto for persistence. 

Unfortunately, this project is blocked by a critical bug - Pluto 2.4.1 doesn't persist suspended coroutines on OS X (Snow Leopard), even with Lua 5.1.3.


Check out kernel/kernel.lua to understand how coroutines are used to make asynchronous waits synchronous.
